## Project Overview

This repository contains an HTML recreation of a pre-1990 Urdu newspaper front page. The implementation emphasizes semantic HTML5 structure and inline styling to recreate the visual and structural characteristics of a traditional newspaper front page. Accessibility, document semantics, and clean markup were prioritized.

---

## Implemented Features

- Proper HTML5 doctype and metadata
- Use of semantic elements (`header`, `article`, `section` etc)
- Multi-column layout using inline flexbox and `columns` properties
- Editorial header implemented with a table-based structure for authenticity
- Responsive image handling using fixed containers and `object-fit` where appropriate
- Descriptive `alt` attributes for all images
- Consistent inline styling and clear inline comments for maintainability

### Key Statistics

- Total HTML elements: approximately 50
- Total lines of code: approximately 200
- Semantic tags used: header, article, section
- Images: 6

## Challenges and Solutions

- Multi-column layout without external CSS: resolved using inline flexbox and column properties.
- Maintaining semantic structure while recreating a vintage layout: addressed by careful nesting of semantic elements and selective use of tables for header composition.
- Image accessibility and consistent display: ensured via descriptive `alt` attributes and fixed container sizing.

---

## Testing and Validation

- Manual testing in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- HTML validated using standard validation tools
- Accessibility considerations applied with alt text and semantic structure

---

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the recreated newspaper front page. Images are served from the `images/` directory.

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced understanding of semantic HTML5 markup
- Practical experience with inline styling for layout
- Increased awareness of accessibility and validation practices
